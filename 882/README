Use the included GNU make Makefile to build on Unix-like systems. strace or
ltrace is required to trace the underlying calls to connect. Without some kind
of trace tool, it will be difficult to see the problem.

With all the tests below, the connect calls are traced and are timestamped with
the time between calls. The ZAP request handler also prints the ZAP request and
reply. ZMQ_RECONNECT_IVL is set to 200, ZMQ_RECONNECT_IVL_MAX is 5000, and
ZMQ_SNDTIMEO is 30000. ZMQ_IMMEDIATE is also enabled.


To build the test:

  $ make


To show the behavior when connect and authentication succeed, make the no-fail
target:

  $ make no-fail

The no-fail test issues a single connect, authentication succeeds, the bounce
test succeeds, and the process exits almost immediately.


To show the behavior when connect fails, make the connect-fail target:

  $ make connect-fail

The connect-fail test issues a succession of connect calls to the wrong port,
with the time between each call roughly doubling from the previous call,
starting with the value of ZMQ_RECONNECT_IVL and plateauing at about
ZMQ_RECONNECT_IVL_MAX. The process will assert and exit after about 30 seconds,
when zmq_send() times out. This is the expected behavior.


Finally, to show the behavior when connect succeeds but authentication fails,
make the auth-fail:

  $ make auth-fail

As with the connect-fail test, the auth-fail test issues a series of connect
calls, but the time between calls is roughly the value of ZMQ_RECONNECT_IVL,
never increasing toward ZMQ_RECONNECT_IVL_MAX. Also, zmq_send succeeds almost
immediately and is never allowed to time out due to an unsuccessful ZAP
handshake (issue #882).
