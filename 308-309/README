This test case requires a V2 publisher and a V3 subscriber, or a V3
publisher and a V2 subscriber.  The publisher connects and the
subscriber binds.

On my system, libzmq V2 is installed in /usr and libzmq V3 is installed
in /usr/local. (The 'compile' script assumes these paths.)

There are four test scripts ('test2-2', 'test2-3', 'test3-2', 'test3-3')
that run the four possible combinations of (V2 publisher, V3 publisher)
X (V2 subscriber, V3 subscriber).

Here are the current results of all four combinations:

    V2 publisher, V2 subscriber => success

    V3 publisher, V3 subscriber => success

    V2 publisher, V3 subscriber => V3 subscriber crashes with:
        Assertion failed: options.recv_identity (socket_base.cpp:864)

    V3 publisher, V2 subscriber => V3 publisher crashes with:
        Assertion failed: size > 0 && (*data == 0 || *data == 1) (xpub.cpp:66)
